# Blog System Specification
## Perfect8 Blog Platform

### 1. Introduction

This document specifies the requirements and architecture for the Perfect8 Blog, a modern blogging platform built with Java and Spring Boot. The system will provide content publishing capabilities with support for text, images, and links while maintaining security and performance through a microservice architecture.

### 2. System Overview

The Perfect8 Blog will be implemented as a set of microservices:
- **Blog Service**: Manages blog posts, users, authentication, and administration
- **Image Service**: Handles image storage and retrieval

Each service will have its own dedicated MySQL database container, creating a clear separation of concerns and improving scalability.

### 3. User Roles

The system will support three distinct user types:

1. **Writers**
   - Can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts
   - Can upload images for their posts
   - Can include links in their posts

2. **Readers**
   - Can view published blog posts
   - No login required for basic reading functionality
   - Cannot add comments (comments functionality may be added later via Disqus integration)

3. **Administrators**
   - Can manage user accounts
   - Can perform system maintenance and backups
   - Have access to all posts for moderation if needed

### 4. Technical Architecture

#### 4.1 Blog Service

**Purpose**: Core blog functionality, authentication, and user management

**Key Components**:
- Authentication system using JWT tokens
- Post management (CRUD operations)
- User management
- Link management
- Image reference management (storing links to images in the Image Service)

**Database**: MySQL container for blog data (posts, users, references)

#### 4.2 Image Service

**Purpose**: Dedicated service for image storage and retrieval

**Key Components**:
- Image upload functionality
- Image retrieval API
- Image metadata management
- Image optimization as needed

**Database**: Separate MySQL container specifically for images and their metadata

#### 4.3 Communication

The services will communicate through RESTful APIs:
- Blog Service will call Image Service when images need to be retrieved or stored
- Authentication tokens will be passed between services to maintain security

### 5. Core Features

#### 5.1 Content Management
- Rich text editing for blog posts
- Support for multiple images per post
- URL embedding and link management
- Draft saving and publishing workflow

#### 5.2 User Management
- Secure registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Password recovery functionality

#### 5.3 Image Handling
- Upload of common image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF)
- Automatic resizing and optimization
- Secure storage and retrieval

#### 5.4 Administration
- User management console
- Backup and restore functionality
- System monitoring

### 6. Technical Requirements

#### 6.1 Backend
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.5
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API design

#### 6.2 Database
- MySQL 8+
- Separate databases for blog and image services

#### 6.3 Deployment
- Docker containers for services and databases
- Docker Compose for orchestration

### 7. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 7.1 Performance
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- Support for concurrent users
- Efficient image delivery

#### 7.2 Security
- HTTPS encryption
- JWT token authentication
- Input validation
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities

#### 7.3 Scalability
- Microservice architecture to allow independent scaling
- Stateless design where possible

#### 7.4 Maintainability
- Clean code structure following best practices
- Comprehensive documentation
- Unit and integration tests

### 8. Future Considerations

- Comment functionality via Disqus integration
- Analytics integration
- Social media sharing
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Content recommendation engine

### 9. Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Blog Service
- User authentication and authorization
- Basic post management
- Initial admin functionality

#### Phase 2: Image Service
- Image upload and storage functionality
- Integration with Blog Service

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
- Improved text editor
- Link management
- Admin dashboard enhancements

#### Phase 4: Deployment and Testing
- Docker configuration
- Performance testing
- Security auditing

### 10. Conclusion

This specification outlines the development of a modern, secure, and scalable blog platform using Java and Spring Boot with a microservice architecture. The separation of the blog and image services provides clear boundaries of responsibility and improves maintainability and scalability of the system.
